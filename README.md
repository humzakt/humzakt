### Hi there 👋

I'm an AI Engineer at **[Turing](https://www.turing.com)**, where I build intelligent systems and automations that bridge the gap between foundational models and practical, scalable software.

### What I'm Currently Working On

*   🤖 Architecting and developing **agentic automations** to streamline internal development workflows.
*   🚀 Building robust backend services with a modern tech stack: `Python`, `FastAPI`, `RAG`, `PostgreSQL`, `Redis`, and `GCP`.

### My Background

*   🧠 Previously, I specialized in enhancing LLMs through **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**, reasoning tasks, and Code Interpreter development for industry leaders like **Apple, Meta, and Bytedance**.
*   📈 I progressed from an LLM Developer to a **Pod Lead**, where I managed a globally-distributed team of 10+ AI trainers, ensuring the delivery of high-quality model evaluations.
